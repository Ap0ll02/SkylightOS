Skylight OS is a (mostly) 2D puzzle game, with the player set in the theme of an upside down IT world, where a malevolent operating system poses threats and tasks the user must navigate and complete. Skylight OS has a great depth of features, including an inode based filesystem, a terminal, 3 different bosses, and more!
